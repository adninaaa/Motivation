	<h1>MY MOTIVATION ON STUDYING ONLINE</h1>

	<p>I am Nur Adnina binti Amran and I am a degree student in Office System Management at UiTM Kelantan.</p>
	<p>Malaysia has been hit by the Corona Virus. So, all the student need to learn online which is called <q>Open Distance Learning</q></p>
	<p>It may be hard for me but I love challenges and new circumstances</p>
<p>So, this situation make me more motivate to prove to all people out there especially my family that I can be the best</p>
<p>Besides that, I want to promote the UiTM Kelantan name throughout Malaysia</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a quote that always motivate me, <q><b>to be in the top 1% you have to be willing to do what the other 99% are not<b/></q></p>

<p><i>Thank You.<i/></p>
